## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have:

- g++ / MinGW (Windows)

- OpenGL

- FreeGLUT

- GLU

FreeGLUT .dll files must be placed next to the executable on Windows.

# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL. 
git clonehttps://github.com/shaawtymaker/Spaceship-Game-OpenGL.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory. 
cd Spaceship-Game-OpenGL 

# Step 3: open termial in the project directory and run 
g++ spaceship_fixed.cpp -o spaceship.exe -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -lglu32 

# Step 4: run the .exe file
